Simon Chioini is an artist-researcher and composer. His work explores the relationships between sound, the environment, and social dynamics through an interdisciplinary lens. Drawing from philosophy, geography, and anthropology, he seeks to rethink sound composition through ecological and relational approaches. In the context of the current climate crisis, his practice challenges the divide between nature and culture by investigating how sound art can serve as a tool for mediation and transformation. His methodology combines theoretical research with site-specific creative practices, often involving performative, participatory, and context-responsive elements. Alongside his academic work, he continues his electronic and experimental music projects as S. Chioini and with the Humidex collective.
